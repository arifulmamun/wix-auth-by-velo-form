# wix-auth-by-velo-form
Wix  authorization by custom code[velo].In this page you can set up a custom velo form and add a members area app. 

--------------
Step by Step
--------------
1. Use lightbox and tab from the add element panel.
2. Use Icon(user-icon) and set at the top right corner.
3. Make a connection manually Icon and lightbox so that when click members redirect on signup lightbox.
4. I don't use password reset by velo it is only by default wix password reset.
5. During the members sign up proccess I save email id one custom DATABASE for other purpose.
Any question regarding this issue comment me.

You can get email verification during sign up complete process if you set up dashboard[not editor dashboard]
contact > site member > signup privacy[dropdown] > send email verify code.

Have fun!
