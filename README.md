# wix-auth-by-velo-form
Wix  authorization by custom code[velo].In this page you can set up a custom velo form and add a members area app. 

--------------
Step by Step
--------------
1. Use lightbox and tab form the add element panel.
2. Use Icon(user-icon) and set at the top right corner.
3. Make a connection manually Icon and lightbox so that when click members redirect on signup lightbox.
4. I don't use password reset by velo it in only by default wix password reset.

Any question regarding this issue comment me.

Have fun!
